# Template Project
This is a template project containing both server and client code.

The server is set up to run against AWS with access to S3 and DynamoDB. Basic account infrastructure is in place.

The client is relatively bare bones, with plumbing in place for dispatching actions and displaying dialogs.

The main content area just has some sample code that allows picking files and displays them in a table,
indicating whether they are parsable as JSON.

Fork this project to customize.
